# MovieApp

## About The Project

The application uses The Movie Database (TMDB) - The Movie Database API. Application where you can search movies, various TV series and where you can see the latest and most popular movies. It will also be possible to view TV series, actors, details about actors and movies and the series in which they have acted.
Main focus of this project was learning and practising new technologies for frontend using public API.

A website link is available, so give it a try :)
